# PK Build Identifier
## About
A RuneLite plugin which tries to read other player's skills and worn equipment to assume and identify their PK account build. 
Right-clicking on players will give a 'View Build' option, opening a RuneLite side-panel displaying the PK build, a description, possible weapons and gear, and tips for fighting against it.
