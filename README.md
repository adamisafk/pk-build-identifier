# PK Build Indicator
## About
A RuneLite plugin which tries to read other player's skills and worn equipment to assume and label their PK account build. 
Right-clicking on players will give a 'See Build' option, opening a RuneLite side-panel displaying the PK build, a description, possible weapons and gear, and tips for fighting against it.

It's intended to be used with Player Indicators, a default RuneLite plugin.
